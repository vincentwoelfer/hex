# TODO
- collision layer -> path smoothing only with rocks, not floor (or enemies ...)
- detect nav-mesh islands -> delete / prevent
- detect stuck enemies
- align trerrain-gen with nav-mesh capabilities
    - improve smooth edges. 1) take neighbour hex into account? 2) change inner circle, if dist inner-circle to edge is very small -> sharp edges.

- Nav-Mesh Generation verbessern?
- Thread-Safe materials?
